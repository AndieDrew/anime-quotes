## Overview

With limited time and a niche audience being targeted the goal of this project was to produce an MVP demonstrating our React, Router, Asynchronous JavaScript and cypress skills with attention to user personas. I chose the Animechan API for my niche audience and tailored my application for the specific user personas. Anime Quotes is an application for anime fans who like quick, easy, intuitive access to their favorite anime quotes and usually use the application in the dark on mobile devices.

Application is fully responsive and accessible.

## Learning Goals

- Refine React, Router, Asynchronous Javascript, Cypress testing skills with best practices.
- Implement TypeChecking with PropTypes.
- Refine project management skills and professionalism by having an organized project board, descriptive PR's, atomic commits that accurately track the progression of the project, and a thorough README.
- Demonstrate attention to detail with accessability and responsiveness.
- Learn to tailer an application to a very specific audience.

## Features

On application launch, the user will be greeted with a random anime quote with the anime and character name. The user can click the 'New Quote' button to generate a new quote, or click the 'Favorite' button to add the current quote to a list of favorites. User can navigate to the Favorites page by clicking the 'Favorites' button at the top right of the screen so they can view a list of all their favorite quotes. User can navigate back to the home page by clicking the 'Home' button at the top right of the screen.
